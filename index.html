allow them to stay relevant during this transition. it involved a
young, clever raccoon that would prove to be a hit with sony fans
across the world. </b>

THE RISE OF THE LEGENDARY PS2 TRILOGY!</b>

Bold <b>FORMULATING A PLAN</b>
Bold <b>After releasing their first game, Rocket Robot on Wheels,
Suckerpunch quickly found themselves struggling to create an IP
that would stick with audiences. With a character design that many
considered to be uninspired, along with the rest of the game
following suit, Suckerpunch needed a new plan, and fast.</b>

<small>Sly Cooper was intially envisioned
as being a lot more accurate to a
real life raccoon, complete with
big proportions. This design would
later be overhauled to appear
more sleek and agile.</small>

<p>Going back to the drawing board,
the team very quickly came up with
the idea to create a game where
the world and characters looked
cartoonish, but with a touch of
realism to them as well. This is how
they came up with the concept for
the character, Sly Cooper.</p>
