<mark>A STEALTHY APPROACH</mark>
Bold <b>During a time when mascot Platformers were going out of style, a
studio by the name of “Suckerpunch” hatched a scheme that would
allow them to stay relevant during this transition. it involved a
young, clever raccoon that would prove to be a hit with sony fans
across the world. </b>

THE RISE OF THE LEGENDARY PS2 TRILOGY!</b>

Bold <b>FORMULATING A PLAN</b>
Bold <b>After releasing their first game, Rocket Robot on Wheels,
Suckerpunch quickly found themselves struggling to create an IP
that would stick with audiences. With a character design that many
considered to be uninspired, along with the rest of the game
following suit, Suckerpunch needed a new plan, and fast.</b>

<small>Sly Cooper was intially envisioned
as being a lot more accurate to a
real life raccoon, complete with
big proportions. This design would
later be overhauled to appear
more sleek and agile.</small>

<p>Going back to the drawing board,
the team very quickly came up with
the idea to create a game where
the world and characters looked
cartoonish, but with a touch of
realism to them as well. This is how
they came up with the concept for
the character, Sly Cooper.</p>

<h1> Developer Quotes </h1>
<h2> This is Heading 2 </h2>
<p>“When you look at the
game intially, the first
thing that draws you in
is the beuatiful art style
and the very lush look
of the environments,
which is also reflected in
the gameplay.”
                 ~Grady Hunt</p>

<h2> A CHARMING
PROTAGONIST </h2>
<p>“My main job was to try
to put every bit of
‘thiefiness’ into him that
I could. When tiptoeing,
he really leans
backwards, trying to
keep his weight back to
sneak quietly.”
              ~Reid Johnson</p>

<h2> A COMPELLING
GAMEPLAY LOOP </h2>
<p>“We wanted Sly to feel
really agile. We wanted
the player to feel like
Sly could do the most
amazing physical feats,
and that they could feel
like the kind of thief
they wish thieves were.”
       ~Chris Zimmerman
