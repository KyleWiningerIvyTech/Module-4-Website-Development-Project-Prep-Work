<mark>A STEALTHY APPROACH</mark> <br/>
<b>During a time when mascot Platformers were going out of style, a
studio by the name of “Suckerpunch” hatched a scheme that would
allow them to stay relevant during this transition. it involved a
young, clever raccoon that would prove to be a hit with sony fans
across the world. </b>

THE RISE OF THE LEGENDARY PS2 TRILOGY!</b>

Bold <b>FORMULATING A PLAN</b>
Bold <b>After releasing their first game, Rocket Robot on Wheels,
Suckerpunch quickly found themselves struggling to create an IP
that would stick with audiences. With a character design that many
considered to be uninspired, along with the rest of the game
following suit, Suckerpunch needed a new plan, and fast.</b>

<small>Sly Cooper was intially envisioned
as being a lot more accurate to a
real life raccoon, complete with
big proportions. This design would
later be overhauled to appear
more sleek and agile.</small>

<p>Going back to the drawing board,
the team very quickly came up with
the idea to create a game where
the world and characters looked
cartoonish, but with a touch of
realism to them as well. This is how
they came up with the concept for
the character, Sly Cooper.</p>

<h1> Developer Quotes </h1>
<h2> AN APPEALING VISUAL STYLE </h2>
<p>“When you look at the
game intially, the first
thing that draws you in
is the beuatiful art style
and the very lush look
of the environments,
which is also reflected in
the gameplay.”
                 ~Grady Hunt</p>

<h2> A CHARMING
PROTAGONIST </h2>
<p>“My main job was to try
to put every bit of
‘thiefiness’ into him that
I could. When tiptoeing,
he really leans
backwards, trying to
keep his weight back to
sneak quietly.”
              ~Reid Johnson</p>

<h2> A COMPELLING
GAMEPLAY LOOP </h2>
<p>“We wanted Sly to feel
really agile. We wanted
the player to feel like
Sly could do the most
amazing physical feats,
and that they could feel
like the kind of thief
they wish thieves were.”
       ~Chris Zimmerman

<h2> A STRONG FIRST IMPRESSION </h2> </br>

<p> Sly Cooper and The Thievius Raccoonus was released in September 24, 2002. </p>
    <p>Following its release on the
Playstation 2, Sly Cooper and The
Thievius Raccoonus was received
well by the gaming public. The art
style was a key part in its appeal,
especially the character designs. </p>

<p> Sly Cooper would go on to sell
around 800,000 copies in total.
Despite this however, in order for
Suckerpunch to stay in business,
they would need to once again go
back to the drawing board. With
the knowledge they had gained
from working on Sly Cooper, they
would immediately begin
development on a sequel.

<br></br>
<h2> ADAPTING TO THE TIMES</h2>
<br></br>
<p> Sly 2 Band of Thieves was released in September 14, 2004.</p>
<p> Sly 2 retained a lot of what made
Sly 1 memorable. What is new in
Sly 2 is its more open structure.
The developers drew inspiration
from Disneyland with the world
design, allowing the player to
complete jobs that build towards a
big heist at the end of each
episode. These changes were
welcomed by fans and critics alike.</p>
<p> Sly 2 was a step up from Sly 1 in
the sales department, selling
around 1.2 million copies and
providing Suckerpunch the
necessary funds to stay afloat for
the forseeable future. With this
success, Suckerpunch would begin
development on one last Sly game.
Only this time, it would be a more
enjoyable challenge for the team.
</p>
<br></br>
<h2> ENDING ON A HIGH NOTE</h2>
<br></br>
<p> Sly 3 Honor Among Thieves was released in September 26, 2005.</p>
<p> Thanks to how well Sly 2
performed, the dev team had much
more confidence going in to Sly 3.
Instead of trying to survive as a
studio, they could instead go all
out with Sly 3, filling it with all
kinds of mini games and extra
polish. Fans and critics welcomed
the extra variety to the gameplay
in this final entry.</p>
<p> Sly 3 once again sold around 1.2
million copies, recapturing the glory
of Sly 2 and allowing Suckerpunch
to confidently leave the series
behind and move on to a new IP.
Despite being done with the
franchise however, they left a small
cliffhanger in Sly 3 so that another
developer could take the reins, if
given the chance.
